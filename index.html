        <h3>Some different origami designs</h3>
        
        <a href="http://origami.me/camel/"><img src="camel.png"/></a>
        <p>Camel Origami: There are three species of camels. They are built for the desert and they surprisingly do not store water in their humps.</p>

        <a href="http://origami.me/chameleon/"><img src="chameleon.png"/></a>
        <p>Chameleon Origami: Chameleons feet work like salad tongs and almost half of all known chameleon species live in Madagascar.</p>

        <a href="http://origami.me/pigeon/"><img src="pigeon.png"/></a>
        <p>Pigeon Origami: Pigeons have played a very important role in saving a countless number of lives throughout the history because of their homing skills as well as their pace. During the World War era, Pigeons were known to be faster than telegraph messages. Pigeons are still used by French, Iraqi and Chinese armies.</p>

        <a href="http://origami.me/teddy-bear/"><img src="teddy.png"/></a>
        <p>Teddy Bear Origami: Teddy bears got their name from the story that Teddy Roosevelt refused to shoot a bear cub while on a hunting trip in 1902. The first toy stuffed bear was created by German toymaker Margarete Steiff.</p>

        <a href="http://origami.me/panda/"><img src="panda.png"/></a>
        <p>Panda Origami: They have great camouflage for their environment. Their eyes are different to normal bears.</p>

        <a href="http://origami.me/cicada/"><img src="cicada.png"/></a>
        <p>Cicada Origami: Cicadas are super loud. A bunch of male cicadas can get really loud! Cicadas live a really long time. A periodical cicada nymph climbs out of the ground after 17 years of living off tree roots.</p>
